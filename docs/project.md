# What is NicTrack?

NicTrack is an app that helps users track their daily nicotine intake, with the purpose of minimizing it.

# Main features

The main app screen features a user friendly way to check how much nicotine the user has taken on that day. It will also let the user register if they've used any more,
which will add to the limit they have set for themselves.
The user will be able to select from a wide range of nicotine products, or maunually type in the amount they took in if the product is not available in the list.
In the future, the user might be rewarded for not reaching their daily limit, or the app will silently decrease the limit every week when it notices the user has not passed the threshold that week.

# UI/UX

The app will feature eye pleasing themes, as well as custom themes down the line. This will help the users feel more personally about the app, perhaps encouraging them to use it more.
The nicotine tracker will be a half or 3/4 circle with a mg number inside it. The app might feature multiple tabs if it is required.
NicTrack aims to be as user friendly and easy to use as possible.

# Target audience

The app is directed to mostly anyone who struggles with nicotine addiction, but mostly teenagers/young adults.
